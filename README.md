# Network License Manager for MATLAB on Microsoft Azure (Windows VM)

This repository shows how to automate the process of starting a Network License Manager for MATLAB速  running on a Windows速  virtual machine, in your Azure速  account. The cloud resources are created using Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates. For information about the architecture of this solution, see [Learn about Architecture](#learn-about-architecture).

# Requirements

You need:

- An Azure account.

- A valid MathWorks速  license. For more information on how to configure your license for cloud use, see [License Requirements for MATLAB on Cloud Platforms](https://www.mathworks.com/help/install/license/licensing-for-mathworks-products-running-on-the-cloud.html).

- Administrator status for the network license you want to use.

# Costs
You are responsible for the cost of the Azure services used when you create cloud resources using this guide. Resource settings, such as instance type, affect the cost of deployment. For cost estimates, see the pricing pages for each Azure service you will be using. Prices are subject to change.


# Deployment Steps

To view instructions for deploying the Network License Manager for MATLAB reference architecture, select a MATLAB release:

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> MathWorks recommends using the template for the [Latest](releases/v1/latest/README.md) release, which is also compatible with prior releases of MATLAB, MATLAB Parallel Server, and MATLAB Production Server. From May 2025, this will be the only template listed here.

## Learn about Architecture

The network license manager and the resources it requires are created using [Azure Resource Manager templates](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-overview). The architecture of the server resources created by the template is illustrated in Figure 2. For more information about each resource, see the [Azure template reference.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/templates/)

*Figure 2: Network License Manager Architecture*

The following resources are created.

### Networking Resources
* Virtual Network (Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks) The Virtual Network includes the following components:
    * Subnet (Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets)
    * Network Security Group (Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups) : Ingress rules from client IP address:
        * Allow 3389: Required for Remote Desktop Protocol to connect to the network license manager server.
        * Allow 22: Required for SSH into the network license manager server.
        * Allow 443: Required for communication between client and network license manager for MATLAB Dashboard server.
        * Allow 27000-27010: Required for communication from MATLAB and MATLAB workers to the network license manager for MATLAB.
        * Allow all internal traffic: Open access to network traffic between all cluster nodes internally.
* Network interface (Microsoft.Network/networkInterfaces)
* Optional Public IP Address (Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses)

### Instances
* Network license manager instance (Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines): A Compute instance for the license server.
  * Custom Script Extension (Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/extensions): An extension which configures this instance at deployment time to start the network license manager for MATLAB Dashboard web server.
